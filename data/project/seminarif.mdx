## What is this?

This is a web application that displays Informatics student seminar schedules.

You can see it on [here](https://seminar.dalamkotak.com/)

## Why made this?

The default schedule was in Google Sheet. But I was too lazy to open the Sheet cuz it slow and not sorted.

So I made it using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Google API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts) to fetch the data from Google Sheet.
